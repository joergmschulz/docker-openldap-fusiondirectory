# Dependencies

- To build this image you must have the [OpenLDAP Image](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-openldap) built and available. To utilize, you must also have the [Fusion Directory Image](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-fusiondirectory) image built and available.

## Installation
### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/openldap-fusiondirectory) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull tiredofit/openldap-fusiondirectory:(imagetag)
```
The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Version | OpenLDAP Version | Container OS | Tag        |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| `1.4.x` | 2.6.x            | Alpine       | `:latest`  |
| `1.4.x` | 2.6.x            | Alpine       | `:2.6-1.4` |
| `1.4.x` | 2.4.x            | Alpine       | `:2.4-1.4` |
| `1.3.x` | 2.4.x            | Alpine       | `:2.4-1.3` |

### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v6`, `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Make [networking ports](#networking) available for public access if necessary
__NOTE__: Please allow up to 2 minutes for the application to start for the first time if you are generating self signed TLS certificates.

### Persistent Storage

* Please see [OpenLDAP Image](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-openldap) for Data Volume Configuration.

There is an additional data volume exposed:

| Directory                         | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/assets/fusiondirectory-custom/` | Place Schema files here to be imported into FusionDirectory |

### Environment Variables

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                     | Description                            |
